2.What is the most useful feature recently added to your favorite programming language?
 Please include a code snippet to demonstrate how you use it.

In this project, I used some modern features of C# and .NET, like:

Minimal API for clean and fast endpoint creation  
Clean Architecture to keep the project organized and scalable
Best Log Tools:
"Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Information()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File(
        path: $@"{builder.Configuration["SeriLogOptions:LogFilePath"]}{builder.Configuration["SeriLogOptions:LogFileName"]}.txt",
        rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger();
builder.Host.UseSerilog(Log.Logger);"

3.How do you identify and diagnose a performance issue in a production environment?
 Have you done this before?

To find performance problems in a real environment I usually:

Check CPU, RAM, response time, and TPS and RPS 
Use logging tools like Serilog aNd Collaborator Monitoring Team To Find This.
Check slow database queries using SQL Profiler or EF Core logging

4.What’s the last technical book you read or technical conference you attended?
 What did you learn from it?

I joined a session about Microsoft Agent Framework, presented by Mr. Sepehr Pakbaz (Microsoft Solution Architect).

Things I learned:

- AI is moving toward smart and autonomous AI Agents  
- Microsoft is following this direction with Azure and Copilot  
- We talked about Agent structure, memory, event-driven architecture, and orchestration

5.What’s your opinion about this technical test?

I think this test was interesting.  
It helped me learn and work with the OpenWeather API.  
It was simple but useful and close to real projects.
